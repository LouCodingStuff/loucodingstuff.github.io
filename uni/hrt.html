        <p>
            Welcome to the HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) page. This page is dedicated to talking about hormones that
            are often taken by Transgender Women to help them feel more comfortable in their bodies due to the changes
            that these hormones bring about.

        <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 20px; margin: 0px;">Estrogen is the main sex hormone in female bodies
            which is responsible for effecting a wide range of things in the female body, like the menstrual cycle,
            estrogen affects the reproductive tract, breasts, and the brain. This hormones however can me supplemented
            in the body of Transgender Women to better align the body of that person with their gender identity. The use
            of estrogen in HRT is often used to ease the pressure that one feels due to Gender Dysphoria (a condition
            defined as a marked incongruence between ones experienced or expressed gender identity and the gender they
            were assigned at birth). The effects of taking Estrogen as a Transwoman can vary between persons, however
            the most commen results of it are, Breast growth, fat distribution changes (fat is likley to build around
            the hips and thighs and the muscles in the arms and legs become less defined), and slowed growth of body
            hair (this is sometimes aided too by taking another part of HRT called Anti-Androgens). There also some
            "negatives" to taking Estrogen in Transgender Women who havent recieved bottom surgery, which include
            decreased testicular size and erectile dysfuntion.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 20px; margin: 0px;">Anti-Androgens are a type of medication that block
            the effects of the androgen hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone which are the primary sex
            hormones in cisgender males. The two main Anti-Androgen medications are Cyproterone Acetate and
            Spironolactone. In cisgender males androgen hormones are responsible effecting the genital tract, secondary sexual
            characteristics, and fertility. When combined with the use of Estrogen,
            Testosterone stops being the primary sex hormone in the body and Estrogen takes over, this can lead to
            effects like softer skin, decreased body and facial hair growth, and breast development. Another notable anti-androgen is Finasteride which mainly blocks the effects of dihydrotestosterone, this anti-androgen is used in cis-gender males to aid in slowing the rate of which their hairline recedes, which is why it is an option to transgender women aswell but not used primarily due to its ability to only block one hormone.
